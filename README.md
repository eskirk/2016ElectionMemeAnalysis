# 2016ElectionMemeAnalysis

This project used a TFIDF analysis alongside a Random Forest Classifier to analyze the text content of memes.

These memes were categorized based on which candidate they were associated with (Clinton, Trump, or Sanders).

Using the TFIDF, I was able to find the words most highly associated with each candidate and generated conclusions from there. 

To view the analysis, start with the [Introduction](https://github.com/eskirk/2016ElectionMemeAnalysis/blob/master/01-Introduction.ipynb) and work your way through the rest of the file.

Enjoy!
